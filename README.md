# Hand-Assisted-Mouse-Control
Hand Assisted Mouse Control
This Project is developed Using:
Python
OpenCV 
Anaconda

# It Allows Mouse interaction Without Any Physical Touch of Mouse. Frames are feeded directly from WebCam using OpenCV.
This project makes use of the state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures and voice commands, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirements. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by MediaPipe running on top of pybind11.
